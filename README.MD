Macros and scripts for FoundryVTT, namely to extend the Pathfinder 1e system.

I may convert these (read: Custom Conditions) to real modules at some point, if the fancy takes me.


### Custom Conditions 

[Find out more](Custom%20Conditions/README.md)

This is where the good stuff lives. Descriptions TBA.


### Extra Change Targets

[Find out more](Extra%20Change%20Targets/README.md)

Clumsily adds extra change targets to actors. These are related to CMB and CMD for combat manoeuvres, as well as effective size category increases. None are used internally by the system, so this script is of rather limited usefulness.


### Running these
Copy-paste all scripts as script macros in Foundry, and save them. The use the [FVTT Advanced Macros](https://github.com/mclemente/fvtt-advanced-macros) module (or any suitable replacement, I guess) to execute `CustomCondManager` and `ExtraChangeTargets` as world scripts.
